# Poker Chip Counter

This is a computer vision app using [the DEGEN101 model on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/pocketsight-r1e4c/degen101) to count the number of poker chips in an image. I was playing poker with my buddies, and had to count my chips. But then I realized that I could just create an advanced computer vision project instead of doing 3rd grade maths.
